> History of MWS API Documentation

## CI

[![Refresh](https://github.com/bizon/mws-api-doc/actions/workflows/refresh.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/bizon/mws-api-doc/actions/workflows/refresh.yml)

## Motivation

The MWS API documentation often changes without notice from the MWS Team. The aim of this repository is to create an history of the modifications.

A [GitHub Action workflow](https://github.com/bizon/mws-api-doc/actions/workflows/refresh.yml) is executed every day at midnight (GMT). It downloads the doc and generates a Markdown (GFM) version, available in the `doc/` directory of this repository.

The entry point of the documentation is [dev_guide/index.md](doc/en_FR/dev_guide/index.md).
