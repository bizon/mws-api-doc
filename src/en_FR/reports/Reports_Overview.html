		<h1 class="title topictitle1">What you should know about the Amazon MWS Reports API section</h1>

		<div class="body">
			<p class="p">The <span class="ph">Reports API</span> section of the <span class="ph">Amazon Marketplace Web Service (Amazon MWS)</span> API lets you request various reports that
				help you manage your Sell on Amazon business. Report types are specified using the
					<span class="keyword apiname">ReportTypes</span> enumeration. </p>

			<p class="p">Amazon periodically adds new fields and field values to reports.
				Be sure to build report parsers into your <span class="ph">Amazon MWS</span>
				applications that can gracefully handle these types of report updates. For more
				information, see <a class="xref" href="../dev_guide/DG_BuildingRobustApps.html#DG_BuildingRobustApps">Building robust Amazon MWS applications</a>.</p>

			<div class="note important"><span class="importanttitle">Important:</span> Your access to <span class="ph">Amazon MWS</span> data
				depends on the role Amazon assigns you after you submit the <span class="ph">Developer Registration and Assessment form</span>. For more information see <a class="xref" href="../dev_guide/DG_Registering.html#DG_Registering">Registering to use Amazon MWS</a>.</div>

			<p class="p">The report process begins by creating a report request. Next, you obtain a list of
				report requests which shows the report request identifier and status of each
				requested report. Finally, you use the report request identifier from this listing
				to get the actual report. The process steps are as follows: </p>

			<ol class="ol">
				<li class="li">Submit a report request using the <span class="keyword apiname">RequestReport</span> operation.
					This is a request to <span class="ph">Amazon MWS</span> to generate a
					specific report. Note that you can also schedule order report requests to be
					submitted periodically using the <span class="keyword apiname">ManageReportSchedule</span>
					operation. </li>

				<li class="li">Submit a request using the <span class="keyword apiname">GetReportRequestList</span> operation to
					get a list that shows the report requests and the status and ID of each report
					request. <span class="ph">Amazon MWS</span> returns a
						<span class="keyword parmname">ReportRequestId</span> for every report requested. When <span class="ph">Amazon MWS</span> sets the status of a report request to
						<var class="keyword varname">_DONE_</var>, the report is ready to be retrieved. Some reports
					create a <span class="keyword parmname">GeneratedReportId</span> that you can pass to the
						<span class="keyword apiname">GetReport</span> operation (see step 4). If you need to cancel a
					report request, use the <span class="keyword apiname">CancelReportRequests</span>
						operation.<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Rather than repeatedly polling the
							<span class="keyword apiname">GetReportRequestList</span> operation to find out when
						report processing is complete, Amazon recommends subscribing to the
							<span class="keyword parmname">ReportProcessingFinishedNotification</span> notification.
						After you subscribe, for each report you request Amazon will send you a push
						notification when report processing is complete. This makes your workflow
						more efficient and helps you avoid exceeding the throttling limits of the
							<span class="keyword apiname">GetReportRequestList</span> operation. For more information,
						see <a class="xref" href="Reports_UseReportProcessingFinished.html">Use the ReportProcessingFinished notification when requesting a report</a>.</div>
</li>

				<li class="li">If no <span class="keyword parmname">GeneratedReportId</span> was created, submit a request using
					the <span class="keyword apiname">GetReportList</span> operation and include the
						<span class="keyword parmname">ReportRequestId</span> for the report requested. The operation
					returns a <span class="keyword parmname">ReportId</span> that you can then pass to the
						<span class="keyword apiname">GetReport</span> operation (see step 4). </li>

				<li class="li">Submit a request using the <span class="keyword apiname">GetReport</span> operation to receive a
					specific report. You include in the request the
						<span class="keyword parmname">GeneratedReportId</span> or the <span class="keyword parmname">ReportId</span>
					for the report you want to receive. You then process the Content-MD5 header to
					confirm that the report was not corrupted during transmission. For more
					information on working with the Content-MD5 header, see the <span class="ph">Amazon MWS Developer Guide</span>. </li>

			</ol>

			<p class="p">The following flowchart shows the process for submitting and receiving an on-request
				report: </p>

			<img class="image" src="ReportRequest_flowchart.png"/>
			<p class="p">You can also schedule order report requests so that they are submitted periodically
				by using the <span class="keyword apiname">ManageReportSchedule</span> operation. The
					<span class="keyword apiname">Schedule</span> enumeration is used to specify the time period for
				submitting report requests. You can also get a list of scheduled order report
				requests using the <span class="keyword apiname">GetReportScheduleList</span> operation. </p>
