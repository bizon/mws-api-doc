				<ul class="ul">
					<li class="li">Developer ID (a 12-digit identifier): <samp class="ph codeph">1234-3214-4321</samp>

					that you truly are the sender of the request, you must also include a digital
					signature. For all requests except those generated using the <span class="ph">Amazon MWS</span> client libraries, you calculate the
					signature using your Secret Key. Amazon uses the AWS Access Key ID in the
					request to look up your Secret Key and then calculates a digital signature with
					the key. If the signature Amazon calculates matches the signature you sent, the
					request is considered authentic. Otherwise, the request fails authentication and
					is not processed. </p>

				<div class="note important"><span class="importanttitle">Important:</span> Your Secret Key is a secret that only you and Amazon should
