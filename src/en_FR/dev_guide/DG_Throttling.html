		<h1 class="title topictitle1">Throttling: Limits to how often you can submit requests</h1>

		
		<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc"> </p>

			<p class="p">To use <span class="ph">Amazon Marketplace Web Service (Amazon MWS)</span> successfully, you need to understand
				throttling. Throttling is the process of limiting the number of requests you (or
				your authorized developer) can submit to a given operation in a given amount of
				time. A request can be when you submit an inventory feed or when you make an order
				report request. Throttling protects the web service from being overwhelmed with
				requests and ensures all authorized developers have access to the web service. See
				our <a class="xref" href="https://sellercentral.amazon.com/learn/courses?ref_=su_home_c54_m243&amp;courseId=54&amp;moduleId=243" target="_blank">MWS: Throttling</a> video at Seller Central
				University for a primer on throttling.</p>

			<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Leaky Bucket Algorithm</h2>
				
				<p class="p"><span class="ph">Amazon MWS</span> uses a variation of the leaky bucket
					algorithm to meter the web service and implement throttling. The algorithm is
					based on the analogy where a bucket has a hole in the bottom from which water
					leaks out at a constant rate. Water can be added to the bucket intermittently,
					but if too much water is added at once or if water is added at too high an
					average rate, the water will exceed the capacity of the bucket. </p>

				<p class="p">To apply this analogy to <span class="ph">Amazon MWS</span>, imagine that
					the bucket represents the maximum request quota, which is the maximum number of
					requests you can make at one time. The hole in the bucket represents the restore
					rate, which is the amount of time it takes to be able to make new requests. So,
					if you submit too many requests at once, then the bucket overflows and, in the
					case of <span class="ph">Amazon MWS</span>, throttling occurs. If you fill
					up the bucket, it takes some time before you can add more water to the bucket
					since the water leaks from the bucket at a steady rate. So the ability to submit
					more requests after you have reached the maximum request quota is governed by
					the restore rate, the time it takes to allow you to make new requests. </p>

			</div>


			<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Throttling Values</h2>
				
				<p class="p">The definitions of these three values that control <span class="ph">Amazon MWS</span> throttling are: </p>

				<ul class="ul">
					<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Request quota</strong> - The number of requests that you can submit at one
						time without throttling. The request quota decreases with each request you
						submit, and increases at the restore rate. Requests are calculated for each
						Amazon seller account and Amazon MWS developer account pair. </li>

					<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Restore rate</strong> (also called the <strong class="ph b">recovery rate</strong>) - The rate at
						which your request quota increases over time, up to the maximum request
						quota. </li>

					<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Maximum request quota</strong> (also called the <strong class="ph b">burst rate</strong>) - The
						maximum size that the request quota can reach. </li>

					<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Hourly request quota</strong> - The maximum number of requests you can submit per hour.</li>

				</ul>

				<p class="p">To apply these ideas, consider this example. Imagine that you want to use the
						<span class="keyword apiname">SubmitFeed</span> operation to submit 25 inventory update feeds.
					The <span class="keyword apiname">SubmitFeed</span> operation has a request quota of 15 and a
					restore rate of one new request every two minutes. If you submit all 25 feed
					requests at once, your requests will be throttled after 15 requests. You would
					then have to resubmit 10 feed requests once the request quota had been restored.
					Since the restore rate is one request every two minutes, it would take 20
					minutes for you to be able to submit the remaining 10 feed requests. So, instead
					of submitting all the requests and having to resubmit the requests that were
					throttled, you could automate your process to submit feed requests
					incrementally. </p>

				<p class="p">For example, you could submit 10 feed requests (out of your original 25 feeds),
					and the request quota would still have five requests left over. You could then
					wait 10 minutes, and the restore rate would have increased the request quota to
					10 (one request every two minutes for 10 minutes gives you five new requests).
					You could then submit 10 more feed requests. For the remaining five feed
					requests, you could wait ten more minutes and then submit them. If all things go
					well, you would have submitted all 25 of your inventory feeds in about 20
					minutes. </p>

				<p class="p">You should consider automating your requests and have a fallback process where,
					if throttling occurs because you reached the maximum request quota or the web
					service experienced high traffic volumes, you could slow down the number of
					requests you make and resubmit requests that initially failed. </p>

			</div>


			<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Hourly Request Quotas</h2>
				
				<p class="p">Some API sections (currently Products, Reports, and Feeds) have an hourly
					request quota in addition to the numerical request quota. This means you have a
					maximum number of requests you can make to a specific operation in a one-hour
					period. The start and end of the one-hour period varies between different
					callers in order to keep overall traffic balanced. For some operations, the
					hourly quota will be less than the restore rate multiplied by one hour. Consult
					the specific operation reference page for the throttling limits.</p>

				<p class="p">For example, <span class="keyword apiname">ListMatchingProducts</span> has a request quota of
					20 requests, refreshing at a rate of one request every five seconds. That works
					out to a maximum of 720 requests per hour if the 20 request quota is not
					exceeded during the hour. The <span class="keyword apiname">ListMatchingProducts</span> operation
					also has an hourly quota of 720 requests. After the 720th request, further
					requests will result in a <span class="keyword parmname">QuotaExceeded</span> error until the
					one-hour quota resets. </p>

				<p class="p"><span class="ph">Amazon MWS</span> provides header values in each call
					response that show the hourly quota for the current operation; the number
					of calls remaining in tha quota; and the date and time when the quota will
					reset. For example:</p>

				<pre class="pre codeblock">x-mws-quota-max: 3600
x-mws-quota-remaining: 10
x-mws-quota-resetsOn: Wed, 06 Mar 2013 19:07:58 GMT</pre>

				<p class="p">You can monitor these headers to determine how many more requests you can
					make until the reset time. </p>

			</div>


			<div class="section" id="DG_Throttling__Best_Practices_Requests"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Tips on avoiding throttling</h2>
				
				<p class="p">There are several things you can do to make sure your feeds and submissions are
					processed successfully: </p>

				<ul class="ul">
					<li class="li">Know the throttling limit of the
						specific request you are submitting. </li>

					<li class="li">Have a "back off" plan for
						automatically reducing the number of requests if the service is unavailable.
						The plan should use the restore rate value to determine when a request
						should be resubmitted. </li>

					
				</ul>

				<p class="p">You should also distribute your requests to maximize service availability:</p>

				<ul class="ul">
					<li class="li">Submit requests at times other than
						on the hour or on the half hour. For example, submit requests at 11 minutes
						after the hour or at 41 minutes after the hour. </li>

					<li class="li">Take advantage of times during the
						day when traffic is likely to be low on Amazon MWS, such as early evening or
						early morning hours. </li>

				</ul>
