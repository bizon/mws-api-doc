		<h1 class="title topictitle1">Data Protection Policy</h1>

		
		<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc"/>

			<p class="p">The Data Protection Policy (<strong class="ph b">"DPP"</strong>) governs the treatment (e.g., receipt,
				storage, usage, transfer, and disposition) of the data vended and retrieved through
				the Marketplace APIs (including the Marketplace Web Service APIs). This Policy
				supplements the Amazon Marketplace Developer Agreement and the <a class="xref" href="DG_AcceptableUsePolicy.html">Acceptable Use Policy</a>. Failure to comply
				may result in suspension or termination of Marketplace API access. </p>

			<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Definitions</strong></p>

			<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">"Application"</strong> means a software application or website that interfaces with the
				Marketplace APIs.</p>

			<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">"Amazon Information"</strong> means any information that is exposed by Amazon through
				the Marketplace APIs, Seller Central, or Amazon's public-facing websites. This data
				can be public or non-public, including Personally Identifiable Information about
				Amazon customers.</p>

			<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">"Customer"</strong> means any person or entity who has purchased items or services from
				Amazon's public-facing websites.</p>

			<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">"Developer" </strong>means any person or entity (including you, if applicable) that
				uses the Marketplace APIs for the purpose of integrating or enhancing a third-party
				Seller's systems with the features and functionality permitted by Amazon to be
				accessed through the Marketplace APIs.</p>

			<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">"Personally Identifiable Information" ("PII") </strong>means information that can be
				used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate an
				individual (e.g., Customer or Seller), or to identify an individual in context. This
				includes, but is not limited to, a Customer or Seller's name, address, e-mail
				address, phone number, gift message content, survey responses, payment details,
				purchases, cookies, digital fingerprint (e.g., browser, user device), IP Address,
				geo-location, or Internet-connected device product identifier.</p>

			<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">"Security Incident"</strong> means any actual or suspected unauthorized access,
				collection, acquisition, use, transmission, disclosure, corruption, or loss of
				Amazon Information, or breach of any environment (i) containing Amazon Information,
				or (ii) managed by a Developer with controls substantially similar to those
				protecting Amazon Information.</p>

			<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">"Seller" </strong>means any person or entity (including you, if applicable) selling on
				Amazon's public-facing websites.</p>

			<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">General Security Requirements</strong></p>

			<p class="p">Consistent with industry-leading security standards and other requirements specified
				by Amazon based on the classification and sensitivity of Amazon Information,
				Developers will maintain physical, administrative, and technical safeguards, and
				other security measures (i) to maintain the security and confidentiality of Amazon
				Information accessed, collected, used, stored, or transmitted by a Developer, and
				(ii) to protect that information from known or reasonably anticipated threats or
				hazards to its security and integrity, accidental loss, alteration, disclosure, and
				all other unlawful forms of processing. Without limitation, the Developer will
				comply with the following requirements:</p>

			<ol class="ol">
				<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Network Protection.</strong> Developers must implement network protection controls
					(e.g., AWS VPC subnet/Security Groups, network firewalls) to deny access to
					unauthorized IP addresses and public access must be restricted only to approved
					users.</li>

				<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Access Management.</strong> Developers must assign a unique ID to each person with
					computer access to Amazon Information. Developers must not create or use
					generic, shared, or default login credentials or user accounts. Developers must
					implement baselining mechanisms to ensure that at all times only the required
					user accounts access Amazon Information. Developers must review the list of
					people and services with access to Amazon Information on a regular basis (at
					least quarterly), and remove accounts that no longer require access. Developers
					must restrict developer employees from storing Amazon data on personal devices.
					Developers will maintain and enforce "account lockout" by detecting anomalous
					usage patterns and log-in attempts, and disabling accounts with access to Amazon
					Information as needed.</li>

				<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Encryption in Transit.</strong> Developers must encrypt all Amazon Information in
					transit (e.g., when the data traverses a network, or is otherwise sent between
					hosts. This can be accomplished using HTTP over TLS (HTTPS). Developers must
					enforce this security control on all applicable external endpoints used by
					customers as well as internal communication channels (e.g., data propagation
					channels among storage layer nodes, connections to external dependencies) and
					operational tooling. Developers must disable communication channels which do not
					provide encryption in transit even if unused (e.g., removing the related dead
					code, configuring dependencies only with encrypted channels, and restricting
					access credentials to use of encrypted channels). Developers must use data
					message-level encryption (e.g., using AWS Encryption SDK) where channel
					encryption (e.g., using TLS) terminates in untrusted multi-tenant hardware
					(e.g., untrusted proxies).</li>

				<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Incident Response Plan.</strong> Developers must create and maintain a plan and/or
					runbook to detect and handle Security Incidents. Such plans must identify the
					incident response roles and responsibilities, define incident types that may
					impact Amazon, define incident response procedures for defined incident types,
					and define an escalation path and procedures to escalate Security Incidents to
					Amazon. Developers must review and verify the plan every six (6) months and
					after any major infrastructure or system change. Developers must investigate
					each Security Incident, and document the incident description, remediation
					actions, and associated corrective process/system controls implemented to
					prevent future recurrence (if applicable). Developers must maintain the chain of
					custody for all evidences or records collected, and such documentation must be
					made available to Amazon on request (if applicable).<p class="p">Developers must inform
						Amazon (via email to security@amazon.com) within 24 hours of detecting any
						Security Incidents. Developers cannot notify any regulatory authority, nor
						any customer, on behalf of Amazon unless Amazon specifically requests in
						writing that the Developer do so. Amazon reserves the right to review and
						approve the form and content of any notification before it is provided to
						any party, unless such notification is required by law, in which case Amazon
						reserves the right to review the form and content of any notification before
						it is provided to any party. Developers must inform Amazon within 24 hours
						when their data is being sought in response to legal process or by
						applicable law.</p>
</li>

				<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Request for Deletion or Return.</strong> Developers must promptly (but within no
					more than 72 hours after Amazon's request), permanently, and securely delete (in
					accordance with industry-standard sanitization processes, e.g., NIST 800-88) or
					return Amazon Information upon and in accordance with Amazon's notice requiring
					deletion and/or return. Developers must also permanently and securely delete all
					live (online or network accessible) instances of Amazon Information within 90
					days after Amazon's notice. If requested by Amazon, the Developer will certify
					in writing that all Amazon Information has been securely destroyed.</li>

			</ol>

			<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Additional Security Requirements Specific to Personally Identifiable
					Information</strong></p>

			<p class="p">The following additional Security Requirements must be met for all Personally
				Identifiable Information ("PII") (see PII definition in Section 1). PII is granted
				to MWS developers for select tax and merchant fulfilled shipping purposes, on a
				must-have basis. If a Marketplace API contains PII, or PII is combined with non-PII,
				then the entire data store must comply with the following requirements:</p>

			<ol class="ol">
				<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Data Retention and Recovery.</strong> Developers will retain PII only for the
					purpose of, and as long as is necessary to fulfill orders (no longer than 30
					days after order shipment), or to calculate/remit taxes. If a Developer is
					required by law to retain archival copies of PII for tax or similar regulatory
					purposes, this archived Amazon Information must be stored as a "cold" or offline
					(e.g., not available for immediate or interactive use) backup stored in a
					physically secure facility, and all archived data on backup media must be
					encrypted. In the event that PII is lost, you must be able to recover all PII
					lost (i.e., the data is erased or unavailable for processing due to system crash
					or ransomware).</li>

				<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Data Governance.</strong> Developers must create, document, and abide by a privacy
					and data handling policy for their Applications or services which govern the
					appropriate conduct and technical controls to be applied in managing and
					protecting information assets. Developers must keep inventory of software and
					physical assets (e.g. computers, mobile devices) with access to PII, and update
					regularly. A record of data processing activities such as specific data fields
					and how they are collected, processed, stored, used, shared, and disposed for
					all PII Information should be maintained to establish accountability and
					compliance with regulations. Developers must establish and abide by their
					privacy policy for customer consent and data rights to access, rectify, erase,
					or stop sharing/processing their information where applicable or required by
					data privacy regulation. </li>

				<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Encryption and Storage.</strong> Developers must encrypt all PII at rest (e.g.,
					when the data is persisted) using industry best practice standards (e.g. using
					either AES-128, AES-256, or RSA with 2048-bit key size (or higher). The
					cryptographic materials (e.g., encryption/decryption keys) and cryptographic
					capabilities (e.g., daemons implementing virtual Trusted Platform Modules and
					providing encryption/decryption APIs) used for encryption of PII at rest must be
					only accessible to the Developer's processes and services. Developers must not
					store PII in removable media (e.g., USB) or unsecured public cloud applications
					(e.g., public links made available through Google Drive). Developers must
					securely dispose of any printed documents containing PII.</li>

				<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Least Privilege Principle.</strong> Developers must implement fine-grained access
					control mechanisms to allow granting rights to any party using the Application
					(e.g., access to a specific set of data at its custody) and the Application's
					operators (e.g., access to specific configuration and maintenance APIs such as
					kill switches) following the principle of least privilege. Application sections
					or features that vend PII must be protected under a unique access role, and
					access should be granted on a "need-to-know" basis.</li>

				<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Logging and Monitoring.</strong> Developers must gather logs to detect
					security-related events (e.g., access and authorization, intrusion attempts,
					configuration changes) to their Applications and systems. Developers must
					implement this logging mechanism on all channels (e.g., service APIs,
					storage-layer APIs, administrative dashboards) providing access to Amazon
					Information. All logs must have access controls to prevent any unauthorized
					access and tampering throughout their lifecycle. Logs themselves should not
					contain PII and must be retained for at least 90 days for reference in the case
					of a Security Incident. Developers must build mechanisms to monitor the logs and
					all system activities to trigger investigative alarms on suspicious actions
					(e.g., multiple unauthorized calls, unexpected request rate and data retrieval
					volume, and access to canary data records). Developers should perform
					investigation when monitoring alarms are triggered, and this should be
					documented in the Developer's Incident Response Plan.</li>

			</ol>

			<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Audit</strong></p>

			<p class="p">Developers must maintain all appropriate books and records reasonably required to
				verify compliance with the Acceptable Use Policy, Data Protection Policy, and Amazon
				Marketplace Developer Agreement during the period of this agreement and for 12
				months thereafter. Upon Amazon's written request, Developers must certify in writing
				to Amazon that they are in compliance with these policies.</p>

			<p class="p">Upon request, Amazon may, or may have an independent certified public accounting firm
				selected by Amazon, audit and inspect the books, records, facilities, operations,
				and security of all systems that are involved with a Developer's application in the
				retrieval, storage, or processing of Amazon Information. Developers must cooperate
				with Amazon or Amazon's auditor in connection with the audit, which may occur at the
				Developer's facilities and/or subcontractor facilities. If the audit reveals
				deficiencies, breaches, and/or failures to comply with our terms, conditions, or
				policies, the Developer must, at its sole cost and expense, and take all actions
				necessary to remediate those deficiencies within an agreed-upon timeframe. </p>
