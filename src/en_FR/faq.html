        <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">11. Why was my request for Amazon MWS Access Keys denied?</strong></p>

        <p class="p">The decision to grant or deny MWS Access Keys is made based on the information that you

          updates will materially impact the application functionality that you provide under the
          terms of the <a class="xref" href="dev_guide/DG_AcceptableUsePolicy.html">Acceptable Use Policy</a>, please respond to your <span class="ph">Developer Registration and Assessment form</span> support case at least five business days

        <p class="p">In order to determine the adjustments you need to make, please read the document attached
          to your individual <span class="ph">Developer Registration and Assessment form</span> case. This document
          outlines the updates to MWS responses based on information you provided in the form. You
          may need to conduct a review of your application to determine whether it can safely handle
          receiving null values for data you may have previously used, either directly or as lookup
          values. You may find it useful to review the "Building robust Amazon MWS applications"
          topic in the Amazon MWS Developer Guide here: <a class="xref" href="dev_guide/DG_BuildingRobustApps.html">Building robust Amazon MWS

        <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">14. What if I need more time to make adjustments to my software application?</strong></p>

        <p class="p">We will consider extensions on a case-by-case basis to allow additional time to modify
          your application to handle updates to MWS responses. If you believe that you require
          additional time to update your application, please respond to your <span class="ph">Developer Registration and Assessment form</span> support case at least five business days
          prior to your adjustment date and ask for an "Extension Request". Please clearly state the
