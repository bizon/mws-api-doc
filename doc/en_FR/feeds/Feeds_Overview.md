## Overview

<div class="body conbody">

The <span class="ph">Amazon MWS</span> <span class="ph">Feeds API</span>
section of the <span class="ph">Amazon Marketplace Web Service (Amazon
MWS)</span> API lets you upload inventory and order data to Amazon. You
can also use the <span class="ph">Amazon MWS</span> <span
class="ph">Feeds API</span> section to get information about the
processing of feeds.

The process for submitting feeds is as follows:

<div class="p">

1.  Submit an XML or flat file using the <span
    class="keyword apiname">SubmitFeed</span> operation along with an
    encrypted header and all required metadata, including a value from
    the
    <a href="../feeds/Feeds_FeedType.md" class="xref"><span class="keyword apiname">FeedType</span></a>.
    As with all submissions to <span class="ph">Amazon MWS</span>, you
    must also include authentication information. The <span
    class="keyword apiname">SubmitFeed</span> operation returns a
    `FeedSubmissionId`, which you can use to periodically check the
    status of the feed using the <span
    class="keyword apiname">GetFeedSubmissionList</span> operation.
    <div class="note note">

    <span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Rather than repeatedly polling
    the <span class="keyword apiname">GetFeedSubmissionList</span>
    operation to find out when feed processing is complete, Amazon
    recommends subscribing to the <span
    class="keyword parmname">FeedProcessingFinishedNotification</span>
    notification. After you subscribe, for each feed you submit Amazon
    will send you a push notification when feed processing is complete.
    This makes your workflow more efficient and helps you avoid
    exceeding the throttling limits of the <span
    class="keyword apiname">GetFeedSubmissionList</span> operation. For
    more information, see
    <a href="../notifications/Notifications_FeedProcessingFinishedNotification.md" class="xref">FeedProcessingFinishedNotification</a>.

    </div>
2.  If <span class="ph">Amazon MWS</span> is still processing a request,
    the <span class="keyword parmname">FeedProcessingStatus</span>
    element of the <span
    class="keyword apiname">GetFeedSubmissionList</span> operation
    returns a status of `_IN_PROGRESS_`. If the processing is complete,
    a status of `_DONE_` is returned.
3.  When the feed processing is complete, you can use the <span
    class="keyword apiname">GetFeedSubmissionResult</span> operation to
    receive a processing report that describes which records in the feed
    were successful and which records generated errors. Note that you
    have to set up a stream that <span class="ph">Amazon MWS</span> uses
    to write out the report when you submit the <span
    class="keyword apiname">GetFeedSubmissionResult</span> operation.
    Use the <span class="ph">Amazon MWS</span> <span class="ph">Feeds
    API</span> section client library code for the <span
    class="keyword apiname">GetFeedSubmissionResult</span> operation to
    create the stream.
4.  Analyze the processing report, correct any errors in the file or
    transmission, and resubmit the feed using the <span
    class="keyword apiname">SubmitFeed</span> operation. Repeat the
    process until there are no errors in the processing report. When the
    processing report is error free, the transmission is complete.
