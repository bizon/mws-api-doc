## Overview

<div class="body conbody">

The <span class="ph">Amazon MWS</span> <span class="ph">Feeds API</span>
section of the <span class="ph">Amazon Marketplace Web Service (Amazon
MWS)</span> API lets you upload inventory and order data to Amazon. You
can also use the <span class="ph">Amazon MWS</span>
<span class="ph">Feeds API</span> section to get information about the
processing of feeds.

The process for submitting feeds is as follows:

<div class="p">

1.  Submit an XML or flat file using the
    <span class="keyword apiname">SubmitFeed</span> operation along with
    an encrypted header and all required metadata, including a value
    from the
    [<span class="keyword apiname">FeedType</span>](../feeds/Feeds_FeedType.html).
    As with all submissions to <span class="ph">Amazon MWS</span>, you
    must also include authentication information. The
    <span class="keyword apiname">SubmitFeed</span> operation returns a
    FeedSubmissionId, which you can use to periodically check the status
    of the feed using the
    <span class="keyword apiname">GetFeedSubmissionList</span>
    operation.
    <div class="note note">
    <span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Rather than repeatedly polling
    the <span class="keyword apiname">GetFeedSubmissionList</span>
    operation to find out when feed processing is complete, Amazon
    recommends subscribing to the
    <span class="keyword parmname">FeedProcessingFinishedNotification</span>
    notification. After you subscribe, for each feed you submit Amazon
    will send you a push notification when feed processing is complete.
    This makes your workflow more efficient and helps you avoid
    exceeding the throttling limits of the
    <span class="keyword apiname">GetFeedSubmissionList</span>
    operation. For more information, see
    [FeedProcessingFinishedNotification](../notifications/Notifications_FeedProcessingFinishedNotification.html).
    </div>
2.  If <span class="ph">Amazon MWS</span> is still processing a request,
    the <span class="keyword parmname">FeedProcessingStatus</span>
    element of the
    <span class="keyword apiname">GetFeedSubmissionList</span> operation
    returns a status of \_IN\_PROGRESS\_. If the processing is complete,
    a status of \_DONE\_ is returned.
3.  When the feed processing is complete, you can use the
    <span class="keyword apiname">GetFeedSubmissionResult</span>
    operation to receive a processing report that describes which
    records in the feed were successful and which records generated
    errors. Note that you have to set up a stream that
    <span class="ph">Amazon MWS</span> uses to write out the report when
    you submit the
    <span class="keyword apiname">GetFeedSubmissionResult</span>
    operation. Use the <span class="ph">Amazon MWS</span>
    <span class="ph">Feeds API</span> section client library code for
    the <span class="keyword apiname">GetFeedSubmissionResult</span>
    operation to create the stream.
4.  Analyze the processing report, correct any errors in the file or
    transmission, and resubmit the feed using the
    <span class="keyword apiname">SubmitFeed</span> operation. Repeat
    the process until there are no errors in the processing report. When
    the processing report is error free, the transmission is complete.
