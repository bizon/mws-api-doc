Use FeedProcessingFinishedNotification when submitting a feed
=============================================================

<div class="body">

When submitting a feed, Amazon recommends using the
<a href="../notifications/Notifications_FeedProcessingFinishedNotification.md" class="xref">FeedProcessingFinishedNotification</a>
notification to find out when feed processing is complete. This
eliminates the need to repeatedly poll the <span
class="keyword apiname">GetFeedSubmissionList</span> operation to find
out when feed processing is complete.

**To submit a feed**

1.  Subscribe to the <span
    class="keyword parmname">FeedProcessingFinishedNotification</span>
    notification.

    This is a one-time task. The <span
    class="keyword parmname">FeedProcessingFinishedNotification</span>
    notification tells you when feed processing is complete. For
    information about subscribing to this notification, see
    <a href="../notifications/Notifications_Overview.md" class="xref">What you should know about Amazon MWS push notifications</a>.

2.  Call the
    <a href="../feeds/Feeds_SubmitFeed.md" class="xref">SubmitFeed</a>
    operation to submit a feed.
    <div class="note note">

    <span class="notetitle">Note:</span> If you are subscribed to the
    <span
    class="keyword parmname">FeedProcessingFinishedNotification</span>
    notification in multiple marketplaces and you specify one or more of
    those marketplaces with a call to the <span
    class="keyword apiname">SubmitFeed</span> operation, you will
    receive a notification for each marketplace that you specify.

    </div>

3.  Wait for the <span
    class="keyword parmname">FeedProcessingFinishedNotification</span>
    notification.

    When feed processing is complete, Amazon sends you the <span
    class="keyword parmname">FeedProcessingFinishedNotification</span>
    notification with the <span
    class="keyword parmname">FeedProcessingStatus</span> element set to
    one of the following values:

    -   `DONE` - The feed was successfully submitted. Use the
        **FeedSubmissionId** value included in the notification as input
        for the
        <a href="../feeds/Feeds_GetFeedSubmissionResult.md" class="xref">GetFeedSubmissionResult</a>
        operation in Step 4.
    -   `CANCELLED` - The feed was cancelled by the seller or by Amazon.

4.  Call the
    <a href="../feeds/Feeds_GetFeedSubmissionResult.md" class="xref">GetFeedSubmissionResult</a>
    operation, specifying the <span
    class="keyword parmname">FeedSubmissionId</span> value from the
    <span
    class="keyword parmname">FeedProcessingFinishedNotification</span>
    notification that you received in Step 3.

    Amazon returns a processing report that describes which records in
    the feed were successful and which records generated errors.

    <div class="note note">

    <span class="notetitle">Note:</span> You have to set up a stream
    that <span class="ph">Amazon MWS</span> uses to write out the
    processing report when you submit the <span
    class="keyword apiname">GetFeedSubmissionResult</span> operation.
    Use the <span class="ph">Amazon MWS</span> <span class="ph">Feeds
    API section</span> client library code for the <span
    class="keyword apiname">GetFeedSubmissionResult</span> operation to
    create the stream.

    </div>

5.  Analyze the processing report, correct any errors in the file or
    transmission, and resubmit the feed using the <span
    class="keyword apiname">SubmitFeed</span> operation. Repeat the
    process until there are no errors in the processing report. When the
    processing report is error free, the transmission is complete.
