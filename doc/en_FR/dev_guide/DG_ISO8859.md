# ISO 8859-1 use in <span class="ph">Amazon MWS</span>

<div class="body">

<span class="ph">Amazon Marketplace Web Service (Amazon MWS)</span> uses
character encoding based on ISO 8859-1. This section will clarify just
how you should format and use character encoding in
<span class="ph">Amazon MWS</span>.

## ISO/IEC 8859-1

*ISO/IEC 8859-1:1998, Information technology — 8-bit single-byte coded
graphic character sets — Part 1: Latin alphabet No. 1*, is part of the
ISO/IEC 8859 series of ASCII-based standard character encodings. It is
generally intended for Western European languages. It is the basis for
the most popular 8-bit character sets, including
<span class="keyword">Windows-1252</span> and the first block of
characters in <span class="keyword">Unicode</span>. The HTML 2.0
standard defined its document character set as ISO 8859-1. HTML5 has
changed this to Unicode character encoding (*ISO/IEC 10646, Information
technology — Universal Coded Character Set (UCS)*). Since the first
block of unicode characters is essentially the same as ISO 8859-1,
compatability is maintained.

Prior to the introduction of Unicode, ISO/IEC 8859-1 was used as the
basis of other encodings and has several aliases. For example,
<span class="keyword">iso-ir-100</span>,
<span class="keyword">csISOLatin1</span>,
<span class="keyword">latin1</span>, <span class="keyword">l1</span>,
<span class="keyword">IBM819</span>, <span class="keyword">CP819</span>,
and others. The safe practice is to conform to ISO 8859-1 when using
<span class="ph">Amazon MWS</span>.
