We are making clarifications and updates to the Amazon Acceptable Use
and Data Protection policies governing the appropriate use of the
Selling Partner API and Amazon Marketplace Web Service (Amazon MWS).
These updates will go into effect on January 1, 2021. We have published
the redlined versions of these policies at the links below for your
convenience.

The Acceptable Use Policy (**"AUP"**) clarifies the appropriate use of
Amazon Marketplace APIs. In addition to the Amazon Marketplace Developer
Agreement, Marketplace Developers must comply with the following
policies. Failure to comply may result in suspension or termination of
Marketplace API access.

**Help Sellers manage their Amazon Business**

*Marketplace APIs are for Developers who wish to help Sellers build,
manage, and grow successful businesses in Amazon's store.*

1.  Use Marketplace APIs only to perform acceptable Amazon Seller
    activities, and only for Amazon Sellers who have authorized you to
    perform these activities on their behalf.
2.  Do not facilitate or promote violation of the Amazon Services
    Business Solutions Agreement, directly or indirectly.
3.  If you discover that a Seller is using your service to violate the
    Amazon Services Business Solutions Agreement, notify Amazon and
    block the Seller's access to your Application.
4.  Keep up to date on Amazon policies that pertain to specific APIs
    (such as the Merchant Fulfillment API, Orders API, and Reports API)
    or specific functionality that your Application provides (such as
    Buyer-Seller messaging).

**Provide quality Applications and services**

*Seller transparency*

1.  Do not falsely advertise your Application or service.
2.  Be clear and honest with Sellers about what data you are accessing
    and for what purpose.
3.  Do not attempt to deceive Sellers by deliberate modification of
    Marketplace API data.
4.  Be explicit about any calculations and the use of models such as
    Artificial Intelligence in the service you provide, their accuracy,
    and data freshness.

*Compliance*

1.  Comply with all applicable laws including data privacy and data
    protection laws (e.g., GDPR, Cybersecurity Law of the People's
    Republic of China).
2.  Do not offer Applications or services that infringe on the
    copyrights, patents, or trademarks of others.
3.  Do not use, offer, or promote external (non-Amazon) data services
    that vend Amazon data, including data retrieved from Amazon's
    public-facing websites.

*Quality and performance*

1.  Provide Application availability, performance, and support required
    to successfully perform the business task.
2.  Identify and mitigate any negative Seller impact before launching
    new features, especially for business-critical tasks.
3.  Design your Application to respect per-Seller throttling quotas.
4.  Implement data integrity and validation checks within your
    Application for any analytical processing (e.g., AI models for
    insights, automated decision-making) that has material impact on a
    Seller's business.

**Keep data secure**

*Account access*

1.  Never share keys or passwords.
2.  Never ask for or accept a Seller's Secret Keys for any purpose.
3.  Only act on behalf of Sellers that have granted you permission
    through third-party authorization.
4.  Do not apply for keys that you will not use. Amazon will baseline
    access keys every 90 days. Keys that do not make a successful call
    in 90 days will be deleted and the Developer will need to re-apply
    for keys.
5.  Do not request or share Seller Central credentials. If necessary,
    ask the Seller to grant Seller Central access through a secondary
    user permission, but do so only if Seller Central is required to
    provide features or services that benefit the Seller.

*Data access and usage*

1.  Do not request access to or retrieve information that is not
    necessary for your Application's functionality.
2.  Only grant access to data on a "need-to-know" basis within your
    organization and among your Application users.
3.  Do not attempt to circumvent throttling quotas through the creation
    of multiple Developer accounts within the same region.

*Data sharing*

1.  Do not disclose information, individually labeled or aggregated,
    obtained through Marketplace APIs on behalf of a Seller to other
    Application users or any outside parties, unless required by law.
2.  Do not calculate or publish insights about the health of Amazon's
    business.
3.  Comply with the
    <a href="DG_DataProtectionPolicy.md" class="xref">Data Protection Policy ("DPP")</a>,
    which provides specific requirements on the receipt, storage, usage,
    transfer, and disposition of the data accessed through Marketplace
    APIs.
