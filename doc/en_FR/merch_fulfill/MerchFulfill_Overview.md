What you should know about the Merchant Fulfillment service
===========================================================

<div class="body">

<div class="section">

With the <span class="ph">Merchant Fulfillment service</span>, you can
build applications that let sellers purchase shipping for non-Prime and
Prime orders using Amazonâ€™s
<a href="https://sellercentral.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/200202220" class="xref">Buy Shipping Services</a>.
To build applications that fulfill Prime orders, see
<a href="MerchFulfill_HowToUseForPrime.md" class="xref">How to fulfill Seller Fulfilled Prime orders</a>.

You can build applications that can:

-   Preview shipping service offers based on shipping requirements: ship
    date, must arrive by date, package size and weight, etc.
-   Create shipments based on shipping service offers that they choose.
-   Automatically pay for shipping through the API service.
-   Receive and print shipping labels.

<div class="note important">

<span class="importanttitle">Important:</span> Your access to <span
class="ph">Amazon MWS</span> data depends on the role Amazon assigns you
after you submit the <span class="ph">Developer Registration and
Assessment form</span>. For more information see
<a href="../dev_guide/DG_Registering.md#DG_Registering" class="xref">Registering to use Amazon MWS</a>.

Terms and conditions
--------------------

Before a seller can use any application that uses the <span
class="ph">Merchant Fulfillment service</span> to fulfill orders, they
need to:

1.  Review and accept the terms and conditions of the Buy Shipping
    Services program.
2.  Review and accept the terms and conditions of any carrier that they
    want to purchase shipping from.

Sellers can review and accept terms and conditions on the
<a href="https://sellercentral.amazon.co.uk/gp/shipping-manager/terms-and-conditions.html/ref=ag_xx_cont_201950090" class="xref">Manage Shipping Services</a>
page of Seller Central. Calling the Merchant Fulfillment service on
behalf of a seller who has not accepted the terms and conditions of
Amazon and the carrier returns the <span
class="keyword parmname">TermsAndConditionsNotAccepted</span> error. See
<a href="MerchFulfill_ErrorCodes.md" class="xref">Error codes</a>.
