# What you should know about the Amazon MWS Subscriptions API section

<div class="body">

<div class="section">

## Overview

The <span class="ph">Amazon MWS</span> <span class="ph">Subscriptions
API section</span> enables you to subscribe to receive notifications
that are relevant to your business with Amazon. With the operations in
the <span class="ph">Subscriptions API section</span>, you can register
to receive important information from Amazon without having to poll the
<span class="ph">Amazon MWS</span> service. Instead, the information is
sent directly to you when an event occurs to which you are subscribed.

To receive notifications, you must first create and register a
<span class="keyword parmname">Destination</span>, such as an Amazon
Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Then, you create a
<span class="keyword parmname">Subscription</span> for the
<span class="keyword parmname">NotificationType</span> that you want to
receive, such as a notification when another Seller has changed their
offer for an item that you also sell. Finally, verify that Amazon is
able to send notifications to your
<span class="keyword parmname">Destination</span> by calling the
<span class="keyword apiname">SendTestNotificationToDestination</span>
operation.

| Destination       | A delivery channel that you create to receive notifications. For example, an Amazon SQS queue with the URL "http://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/12345/queue1".                                                                                                                                                   |
