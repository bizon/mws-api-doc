# Use ReportProcessingFinishedNotification when requesting a report

<div class="body">

When requesting a report, Amazon recommends using the
[ReportProcessingFinishedNotification](../notifications/Notifications_ReportProcessingFinishedNotification.md)
notification to find out when report processing is complete. This
eliminates the need to repeatedly poll the
<span class="keyword apiname">GetReportRequestList</span> operation to
find out when report processing is complete.

**To request a report**

1.  Subscribe to the
    <span class="keyword parmname">ReportProcessingFinishedNotification</span>
    notification.
    
    This is a one-time task. The
    <span class="keyword parmname">ReportProcessingFinishedNotification</span>
    notification tells you when report processing is complete. For
    information about subscribing to this notification, see [What you
    should know about Amazon MWS push
    notifications](../notifications/Notifications_Overview.md).

2.  Call the [RequestReport](../reports/Reports_RequestReport.md)
    operation to request a report.
    
    <div class="note note">
    
    <span class="notetitle">Note:</span> If you are subscribed to the
    <span class="keyword parmname">ReportProcessingFinishedNotification</span>
    notification in multiple marketplaces and you specify one or more of
    those marketplaces with a call to the
    <span class="keyword apiname">RequestReport</span> operation, you
    will receive a notification for each marketplace that you specify.
    
    </div>

3.  Wait for the
    <span class="keyword parmname">ReportProcessingFinishedNotification</span>
    notification.
    
    When report processing is complete, Amazon sends you the
    <span class="keyword parmname">ReportProcessingFinishedNotification</span>
    notification with the
    <span class="keyword parmname">ReportProcessingStatus</span> element
    set to one of the following values:
    
      - DONE - The report was successfully generated. Use the
        **ReportId** value included in the notification as input for the
        [GetReport](../reports/Reports_GetReport.md) operation in Step
        4.
      - CANCELLED - The report was cancelled. See the "Why are my
        reports cancelled?" section of the [Downloading
        Reports](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/forums/t/downloading-reports/185371)
        article in the <span class="ph">Amazon MWS</span> Knowledge Base
        for reasons why reports are cancelled.
      - DONE\_NO\_DATA - The report was generated but there was no data
        to report. This happens when there is no new data to report
        between consecutive report requests. Retry until there is data
        to report.

4.  Call the [GetReport](../reports/Reports_GetReport.md) operation,
    specifying the <span class="keyword parmname">ReportId</span> value
    from the
    <span class="keyword parmname">ReportProcessingFinishedNotification</span>
    notification that you received in Step 3.
