# Getting <span class="ph">Multi-Channel Fulfillment</span> outbound shipment reports

<div class="body conbody">

The <span class="ph">Fulfillment Outbound Shipment API section</span>
has querying functionality for reporting on FBA outbound fulfillment
shipments. Note that the reports that are returned by the
<span class="ph">Fulfillment Outbound Shipment API section</span> apply
only to <span class="ph">Multi-Channel Fulfillment</span> orders.

<div class="p">

Following are some reporting scenarios that the
<span class="ph">Fulfillment Outbound Shipment API section</span> makes
possible:

  - **Get fulfillment previews.** Get previews of potential fulfillment
    orders, which provide estimated shipping costs, shipping dates, and
    arrival dates based on shipping speeds that you submit with the
    <span class="keyword apiname">GetFulfillmentPreview</span>
    operation.
  - **Get status information for a list of
    <span class="ph">Multi-Channel Fulfillment</span> orders.** Get
    status and other order level information for your
    <span class="ph">Multi-Channel Fulfillment</span> orders by calling
    the <span class="keyword apiname">ListAllFulfillmentOrders</span>
    operation.
  - **Get comprehensive information on a single
    <span class="ph">Multi-Channel Fulfillment</span> order.** Get
    comprehensive order, shipment, and order item information for any
    existing <span class="ph">Multi-Channel Fulfillment</span> order by
    calling the <span class="keyword apiname">GetFulfillmentOrder</span>
    operation.
