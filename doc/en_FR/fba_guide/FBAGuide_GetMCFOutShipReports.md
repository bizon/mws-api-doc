Getting <span class="ph">Multi-Channel Fulfillment</span> outbound shipment reports
===================================================================================

<div class="body conbody">

The <span class="ph">Fulfillment Outbound Shipment API section</span>
has querying functionality for reporting on FBA outbound fulfillment
shipments. Note that the reports that are returned by the <span
class="ph">Fulfillment Outbound Shipment API section</span> apply only
to <span class="ph">Multi-Channel Fulfillment</span> orders.

<div class="p">

Following are some reporting scenarios that the <span
class="ph">Fulfillment Outbound Shipment API section</span> makes
possible:

-   **Get fulfillment previews.** Get previews of potential fulfillment
    orders, which provide estimated shipping costs, shipping dates, and
    arrival dates based on shipping speeds that you submit with the
    <span class="keyword apiname">GetFulfillmentPreview</span>
    operation.
-   **Get status information for a list of <span
    class="ph">Multi-Channel Fulfillment</span> orders.** Get status and
    other order level information for your <span
    class="ph">Multi-Channel Fulfillment</span> orders by calling the
    <span class="keyword apiname">ListAllFulfillmentOrders</span>
    operation.
-   **Get comprehensive information on a single <span
    class="ph">Multi-Channel Fulfillment</span> order.** Get
    comprehensive order, shipment, and order item information for any
    existing <span class="ph">Multi-Channel Fulfillment</span> order by
    calling the <span class="keyword apiname">GetFulfillmentOrder</span>
