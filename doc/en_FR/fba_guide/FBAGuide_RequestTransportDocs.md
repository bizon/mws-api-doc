# Step 8 - Request shipping labels for your inbound shipment

<div class="body conbody">

Call the
<a href="../fba_inbound/FBAInbound_GetUniquePackageLabels.md" class="xref">GetUniquePackageLabels</a>
operation to request unique shipping labels for your inbound shipments.

<div class="note important">

<span class="importanttitle">Important:</span> Before calling the <span
class="keyword apiname">GetUniquePackageLabels</span> operation, use the
<a href="../feeds/Feeds_Overview.md" class="xref">Feeds API section</a>
to submit the FBA Inbound Shipment Carton Information Feed (see
<a href="FBAGuide_SubmitCartonContentsFeed.md" class="xref">Step 7</a>).
This provides information to Amazon about the carton contents of your
inbound shipment, which helps to ensure that your shipment is processed
at the <span class="ph">Amazon fulfillment center</span> quickly and
accurately. You must submit this feed before calling the <span
class="keyword apiname">GetUniquePackageLabels</span> operation,
otherwise the operation returns the <span
class="keyword parmname">NoPackageContentInformation</span> error.

</div>

Each shipping label returned by the <span
class="keyword apiname">GetUniquePackageLabels</span> operation should
be affixed to the package in the shipment that it corresponds to, so the
labels indicate the package contents. This helps to ensure that your
shipment is processed at the Amazon fulfillment center quickly and
accurately.

To get shipping labels on the right packages, do the following for each
shipping label:

1.  Get the Package ID, which is the string located directly below the
    bar code of the shipping label. This ID matches one of the <span
    class="keyword parmname">CartonId</span> values that you included in
    the FBA Inbound Shipment Carton Information Feed that you submitted
    in
    <a href="FBAGuide_SubmitCartonContentsFeed.md" class="xref">Step 7</a>.
2.  Determine which package to affix the shipping label to using the
    record of the correspondence between <span
    class="keyword parmname">CartonId</span> values and packages that
    you created in
    <a href="FBAGuide_SubmitCartonContentsFeed.md" class="xref">Step 7</a>.
3.  Affix the label to its corresponding package.

<div class="section">

## Information included on shipping labels

In all circumstances, the <span
class="keyword apiname">GetUniquePackageLabels</span> operation returns
shipping labels that include a unique bar code and Package ID (the
string located directly below the bar code). Depending on the contents
of the packages in your shipments, the labels can also include an ASIN
and an expiration date.

Shipping labels include an ASIN and an expiration date in either of the
following situations:

-   Every item in the shipment shares the same ASIN and expiration date.
-   The shipment includes multiple ASINs, but every package in the
    shipment contains items that share the same ASIN and expiration
    date.

Shipping labels include an ASIN and no expiration date in either of the
following situations:

-   Every item in the shipment shares the same ASIN. The ASIN does not
    have an expiration date.
-   The shipment includes multiple ASINs, but every package in the
    shipment contains items that share the same ASIN. The ASINs do not
    have expiration dates.

Shipping labels do not include an ASIN or an expiration date when the
shipment contains at least one package with items that do not share the
same ASIN and expiration date.
