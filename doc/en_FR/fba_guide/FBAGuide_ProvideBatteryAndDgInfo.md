# Provide battery and dangerous goods information

<div class="body">

Before you can convert a listing to <span class="ph">Fulfillment by
Amazon (FBA)</span> you need to provide additional information on any
products that are batteries, contain or are sold with batteries, or may
be considered dangerous goods (also called hazardous materials or
Hazmat). Any attempt to convert a listing to <span class="ph">FBA</span>
before providing battery and dangerous goods information will fail.

-   **For batteries and products containing or sold with batteries.**
    Provide descriptive characteristics such as battery composition
    (e.g., lithium ion, alkaline, etc.) and the number of batteries.
-   **For products considered dangerous goods.** Provide additional
    information to identify characteristics of the product such as
    flammability or corrosiveness that would indicate the transportation
    classification (UN Number).

For more information about this policy, see
<a href="https://sellercentral-europe.amazon.com/gp/help/201003400" class="xref">Dangerous goods identification guide</a>.

class="ph">FBA</span> inventory see
