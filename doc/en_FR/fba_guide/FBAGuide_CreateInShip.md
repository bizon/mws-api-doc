# Step 4 - Create an inbound shipment

<div class="body conbody">

For each shipment returned by the
<span class="keyword apiname">CreateInboundShipmentPlan</span>
operation, create an inbound shipment. You create an inbound shipment by
calling the <span class="keyword apiname">CreateInboundShipment</span>
operation of the Inbound Shipment API section. Each inbound shipment you
create indicates to Amazon that a shipment of items is soon to arrive at
a particular <span class="ph">Amazon fulfillment center</span>. Each
inbound shipment includes a list of items contained in the shipment, as
well as a destination fulfillment center identifier and your label
preparation preferences for item labels. For more information about
label preparation preferences, see [Label preparation
preferences](FBAGuide_CreateInShipPlan.html).

For code samples for calling the
<span class="keyword apiname">CreateInboundShipment</span> operation,
see the Client Library links on the <span class="ph">Amazon Marketplace
Web Service (Amazon MWS)</span> portal for your region.

For more information, see
[CreateInboundShipment](../fba_inbound/FBAInbound_CreateInboundShipment.html).
