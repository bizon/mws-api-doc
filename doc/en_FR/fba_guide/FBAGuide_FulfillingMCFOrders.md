Fulfilling <span class="ph">Multi-Channel Fulfillment</span> orders
===================================================================

<div class="body conbody">

The <span class="ph">Fulfillment Outbound Shipment API section</span>
and the <span class="ph">Feeds API section</span> (using the **FBA
Shipment Injection Fulfillment Feed** and the **FBA Shipment Injection
Cancellation Feed**) have approximately equivalent functionality in
terms of submitting and cancelling <span class="ph">Multi-Channel
Fulfillment</span> orders. The <span class="ph">Fulfillment Outbound
Shipment API section</span> has the advantage of being real-time,
however, while the <span class="ph">Feeds API section</span> operates
asynchronously.
