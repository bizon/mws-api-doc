# Step 6 - Send shipment tracking numbers to Amazon

<div class="body conbody">

When you use an Amazon-partnered carrier for an inbound shipment, the
carrier provides your shipment tracking numbers to Amazon as part of the
process. However, even if you are not using an Amazon-partnered carrier
for your inbound shipments, Amazon recommends that you send us the
shipment tracking numbers for your inbound shipment. Providing this
information helps Amazon process your inbound shipment at the
<span class="ph">Amazon fulfillment center</span> faster and more
accurately.

**To send shipment tracking numbers to Amazon**

1.  Call the
    [PutTransportContent](../fba_inbound/FBAInbound_PutTransportContent.html)
    operation from the <span class="ph">Fulfillment Inbound Shipment API
    section</span>.

2.  Include your shipment tracking numbers using the
    <span class="keyword parmname">TrackingId</span> parameter.
    Example:
    
    ``` pre codeblock
    &TransportDetails.NonPartneredSmallParcelData.PackageList.member.1.TrackingId=A135KKEKWF1J5666
    ```

## Getting the shipment status of non-Amazon-partnered Small Parcel shipments

After sending shipment tracking numbers for a non-Amazon-partnered
<span class="ph">Small Parcel</span> shipment to Amazon, you can get the
shipment status by calling the
[GetTransportContent](../fba_inbound/FBAInbound_GetTransportContent.html)
operation.

**To get the shipment status for your non-Amazon-partnered Small Parcel
shipment**

1.  Call the <span class="keyword apiname">PutTransportContent</span>
    operation. This provides your shipment tracking numbers to Amazon.
2.  Call the <span class="keyword apiname">GetTransportContent</span>
    operation. Amazon returns shipment status in the
    <span class="keyword parmname">PackageStatus</span> response
    element.
