# Step 11 - Mark your shipments as shipped

<div class="body conbody">

After sending a shipment to <span class="ph">Amazon's fulfillment
network</span>, you should call the
<span class="keyword apiname">UpdateInboundShipment</span> operation of
the Inbound Shipment API section. Include the
<span class="keyword parmname">ShipmentId</span> that you used when you
called the <span class="keyword apiname">CreateInboundShipment</span>
operation for that shipment. Also include the
<span class="keyword parmname">ShipmentStatus</span> request parameter
with its value set to `SHIPPED`. For more information about the Inbound
Shipment API section, see [Fulfillment Inbound Shipment
API](../fba_inbound/FBAInbound_Overview.md). For code samples for
calling the <span class="keyword apiname">UpdateInboundShipment</span>
operation, see the Client Library links on the <span class="ph">Amazon
Marketplace Web Service (Amazon MWS)</span> portal for your region.

For more information, see [Fulfillment Inbound Shipment
API](../fba_inbound/FBAInbound_Overview.md).
