Step 11 - Mark your shipments as shipped
========================================

<div class="body conbody">

After sending a shipment to <span class="ph">Amazon's fulfillment
network</span>, you should call the <span
class="keyword apiname">UpdateInboundShipment</span> operation of the
Inbound Shipment API section. Include the <span
class="keyword parmname">ShipmentId</span> that you used when you called
the <span class="keyword apiname">CreateInboundShipment</span> operation
for that shipment. Also include the <span
class="keyword parmname">ShipmentStatus</span> request parameter with
its value set to `SHIPPED`. For more information about the Inbound
Shipment API section, see
<a href="../fba_inbound/FBAInbound_Overview.md" class="xref">Fulfillment Inbound Shipment API</a>.
For code samples for calling the <span
class="keyword apiname">UpdateInboundShipment</span> operation, see the
Client Library links on the <span class="ph">Amazon Marketplace Web
Service (Amazon MWS)</span> portal for your region.
