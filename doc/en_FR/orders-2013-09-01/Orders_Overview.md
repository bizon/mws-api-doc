# What you should know about the Orders API section

<div class="body conbody">

With the <span class="ph">Orders API section</span> of
<span class="ph">Amazon Marketplace Web Service (Amazon MWS)</span>, you
can build simple applications that retrieve only the order information
that you need. This enables you to develop fast, flexible, custom
applications in areas like order synchronization, order research, and
demand-based decision support tools.

<div class="note important">

<span class="importanttitle">Important:</span> Your access to
<span class="ph">Amazon MWS</span> data depends on the role Amazon
assigns you after you submit the <span class="ph">Developer Registration
and Assessment form</span>. For more information see [Registering to use
Amazon MWS](../dev_guide/DG_Registering.md#DG_Registering).

</div>

The following operations are included in the <span class="ph">Orders API
section</span>:

<div class="tablenoborder">

</div>

You can retrieve order item information by first using the
<span class="keyword apiname">ListOrders</span> operation to find orders
created or updated during a time frame that you specify. An
<span class="keyword parmname">AmazonOrderId</span> is included with
each order that is returned. You can then use these
<span class="keyword parmname">AmazonOrderId</span> values with the
<span class="keyword apiname">ListOrderItems</span> operation to get
detailed order item information for each order.

To determine the URL to use when sending requests to the
<span class="ph">Orders API section</span>, add "/Orders/2013-09-01" to
the endpoint for your marketplace. For example, if your marketplace is
US, the URL would be https://mws.amazonservices.com/Orders/2013-09-01

<div class="section">

## When to use the <span class="ph">Orders API section</span>

The <span class="ph">Orders API section</span> is optimized for data
synchronization, retrieving order updates in real-time, and order
research. For bulk order data reporting, you should create order reports
with the <span class="ph">Reports API</span> section. For more
information about the <span class="ph">Reports API</span> section, see
the <span class="ph">Reports API</span> section documentation.

<td>An item and a quantity. For example, if a customer buys three copies of a particular book, the order contains one order item with a quantity of three. If one of the copies is to be gift wrapped, the order now contains the following two order items:
<ul>
<li>Gift wrapped book, quantity of one</li>
<li>Non-gift wrapped book, quantity of two</li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><span class="keyword parmname">Order</span></td>

<ul>
<li>A collection of order items sold on Amazon with identical values for the following attributes:
<ul>
<li>Shipping address</li>
<li>Shipping speed</li>
<li>Seller</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A Multi-Channel Fulfillment order (an order not sold on Amazon's retail website but fulfilled using your Fulfillment by Amazon inventory).</li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">

**Note for Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) sellers who use Multi-Channel
Fulfillment:** If you submit a removal order and do not include
<span class="keyword parmname">ShippingAddress</span>, the Orders API
section will not return
<span class="keyword parmname">ShippingAddress</span> for that order.
For more information about Multi-Channel Fulfillment, see the Help pages
for the Amazon Seller Central website in your marketplace.
