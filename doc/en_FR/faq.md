# Frequently Asked Questions

<div class="body">

<div id="faq__DeveloperRegistrationAndAssessmentFAQ" class="section">

## **Developer Profile FAQ**

<div class="sectiondiv">

**1. What is the Developer Profile?**

The Developer Profile (formerly the Developer Registration and
Assessment form) allows developers to submit information about their
organization and applications. Amazon then uses this information to
assess compliance with our Amazon Selling Partner API
<a href="https://sellercentral.amazon.com/mws/static/policy?documentType=AUP&amp;locale=en_US" class="xref">Acceptable Use Policy</a>
and the
<a href="https://sellercentral.amazon.com/mws/static/policy?documentType=DPP&amp;locale=en_US" class="xref">Data Protection Policy</a>
requirements and ensures that we provide the level of access that you
require and qualify for. All new and existing developers requiring
additional data access are required to submit their responses to the
Developer Profile..

</div>

<div class="sectiondiv">

**2. What should I expect after I submit my Developer Profile?**

When you submit the Developer Profile, a support case is automatically
created for you. We will contact you with next steps, if any.

</div>

<div class="sectiondiv">

**3. Can I save a draft of my Developer Profile and return to complete
it later?**

If you are completing your Developer Profile for the first time, you may
save a draft and return to complete it later. If you are modifying an
existing Developer Profile, updates save only after you have submitted
for review.

</div>

<div class="sectiondiv">

**4. I am a developer with multiple developer IDs. Do I need to submit a
separate Developer Profile for each developer ID?**

No, you do not need to submit a Developer Profile multiple times. If you
have multiple developer IDs that support the same application, please
enter them in the field under **If you are currently a developer, please
provide your developer ID(s)**. Note that if you have multiple developer
IDs, separate them with commas.

</div>

<div class="sectiondiv">

**5. How do I know what roles I should select in the Developer
Profile?**

Choose the roles you require for your application(s) based on the role
descriptions here -
<https://github.com/amzn/selling-partner-api-docs/blob/main/guides/roles/Roles-in-the-Selling-Partner-API.md>.
Note that access to the Selling Partner API follows the principle of
least privilege, meaning that you will not be able to access APIs within
roles unless you explicitly select those roles in your Developer
Profile.

</div>

<div class="sectiondiv">

**6. How can I access my support case log?**

To access your case log, sign into the Seller Central account that is
associated with your Amazon MWS Access Keys. On the Seller Central
gateway page, at the **Manage Your Case Log** widget, click **View your
case log**. Note that you must be the primary account holder to view
this page.

</div>

<div class="sectiondiv">

**7. What if I want to edit or update my submission?**

If the Developer Profile is under Amazon review, you will be unable to
edit the Developer Profile until the review is complete. However, you
will be able to view your submission. If you would like to update the
Developer Profile while a review is in progress, please indicate the
question(s) that you want to change and provide your updated response(s)
in the support case log that was created after you submitted the form.
After the review is complete, you are free to edit the Developer Profile
if your security controls, use case, or data access needs to change.

</div>

<div class="sectiondiv">

**8. Can I hire someone to help me meet the requirements described in
the Data Protection Policy?**

Yes. The
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/" class="xref">AWS Partner Network</a>
is a resource that might be of assistance.

</div>

<div class="sectiondiv">

**9. I want to submit my Developer Profile but I cannot sign into my
Seller Central account to access the form. What should I do?**

To get help signing into your Seller Central account, go to
<a href="https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/G200123250" class="xref">Seller Central sign in help</a>.

**Send message** to create a support case.

</div>

<div class="sectiondiv">

**10. How was my level of Selling Partner API access decided?**

Access decisions are made based on the information that you provide in
your Developer Profile, including but not limited to your application
functionality and your compliance with the
<a href="https://sellercentral.amazon.com/mws/static/policy?documentType=AUP&amp;locale=en_US" class="xref">Acceptable Use Policy</a>
and the
<a href="https://sellercentral.amazon.com/mws/static/policy?documentType=DPP&amp;locale=en_US" class="xref">Data Protection Policy</a>.
Our goal is to provide you only with the data that is relevant to you in
order to protect customers and simplify your data protection
obligations.

</div>

<div class="sectiondiv">

**11. Why was my request for Selling Partner API access denied?**

The decision to grant or deny Selling Partner API access is made based
on the information that you provide in your Developer Profile, including
but not limited to your application functionality and your compliance
with the
<a href="https://sellercentral.amazon.com/mws/static/policy?documentType=AUP&amp;locale=en_US" class="xref">Acceptable Use Policy</a>
and the
<a href="https://sellercentral.amazon.com/mws/static/policy?documentType=DPP&amp;locale=en_US" class="xref">Data Protection Policy</a>.
We cannot provide detailed information about how we determine Selling
Partner API eligibility, but we prioritize data security in these
decisions.

</div>

<div class="sectiondiv">

**12. What should I do if I want a different level of Selling Partner
API access in the future?**

You can edit your Developer Profile and select additional or fewer roles
at any time except for when your submission is under Amazon review. To
change your roles, go to the Developer Profile and check/uncheck the
roles you wish to access, complete the appropriate questions, and submit
your Developer Profile for Amazon review.

</div>

<div class="sectiondiv">

**13. What should I do if I believe that my request for Selling Partner
API access was wrongly denied?**

Access decisions are made based on the information that you provide in
the Developer Registration and Assessment form, but we will consider
appeals on a case-by-case basis. If you believe that we misunderstood
your Developer Profile inputs, or that the denial of access will
materially impact the application functionality that you provide under
the terms of the
<a href="https://sellercentral.amazon.com/mws/static/policy?documentType=AUP&amp;locale=en_US" class="xref">Acceptable Use Policy</a>,
please respond to your Developer Profile support case at least five
business days prior to your adjustment date and ask for an "Appeal
Request". Please clearly state the reason for your request and offer a
detailed description of the application functionality that is impacted
by the access denial or removal.

</div>

<div class="sectiondiv">

**14. I have been notified that my Amazon MWS level of access is
changing. How should I adjust my application in order to prevent
breakage or service interruptions?**

In order to determine the adjustments that you need to make to your
application, please read the document attached to your Developer Profile
support case. This document outlines the updates to Amazon MWS responses
based on information you provided in your Developer Profile. You may
need to conduct a review of your application to determine whether it can
safely handle receiving null values for data you may have previously
used, either directly or as lookup values. You may find it useful to
review the "Building robust Amazon MWS applications" topic in the Amazon
MWS Developer Guide here:
<a href="http://docs.developer.amazonservices.com/en_US/dev_guide/DG_BuildingRobustApps.md" class="xref">Building robust Amazon MWS applications</a>.

</div>

<div class="sectiondiv">

**15. I have been notified that my Amazon MWS level of access is
changing. What if I need more time to make adjustments to my software
application?**

We will consider extensions on a case-by-case basis to allow additional
time to modify your application to handle updates to MWS responses. If
you believe that you require additional time to update your application,
please respond to your Developer Registration and Assessment form
support case at least five business days prior to your adjustment date
and ask for an "Extension Request". Please clearly state the reason for
your extension request and the work that you intend to complete during
the extension period.

</div>

<div class="sectiondiv">

**16. I have been notified that my Amazon MWS level of access is
changing. How should I adjust my application in order to prevent
breakage or service interruptions?If I have multiple seller accounts
with MWS access, do I need to complete a Developer Profile on each one
to get access to Selling Partner API?**

We require only one Developer Profile per organization. It is a best
practice to select a single seller account to manage all Selling Partner
API access. Unlike Amazon MWS credentials, Selling Partner API
applications are global, meaning you do not need a region-specific
seller account to make calls to that region.

Only the owner of an Amazon selling account can authorize an application
developer to access their selling account. You as the application

get your Developer ID and developer credentials. Then, give your
Developer ID to the seller who wants to use your services as a
developer. When the seller authorizes you as a developer, they use your
Developer ID to give you developer access to their selling account. The
seller must also provide you with their Seller ID so you can make calls
to <span class="ph">Amazon MWS</span> on their behalf. You can give an
Amazon seller the following instructions to guide them through the
process of authorizing you as a developer.
